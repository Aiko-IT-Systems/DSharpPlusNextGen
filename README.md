An unofficial .NET wrapper for the Discord API, based off [DiscordSharp](https://github.com/suicvne/DiscordSharp), but rewritten to fit the API standards.

# Why NextGen?
The way how DSP is working and the maintainer.. I don't like it. I decided to maintain an own version of it.

# Installing
You can install the library from following source:

The latest stable release is always available on [NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/DSharpPlus-NextGen). This branch is less up-to-date than the nightly versions, but is guaranteed to not receive any breaking API changes without a major version bump.

   Critical bugfixes in the nightly releases will usually be backported to the latest major stable release, but only after they have passed our soak tests. Additionally, some smaller fixes may be infrastructurally impossible or very dificult to backport without "breaking everything", and as such they will remain only in the nightly release until the next major release. You should evaluate whether or not this version suits your specific needs.
3. The library can be compiled from source on Windows using Visual Studio 2017 or Visual Studio 2019. Compilation on Mac and GNU/Linux devices is possible using the .NET Core SDK, but you will only be able to build for the .NET Standard targets.

   On Windows, you will need SDKs for .NET 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7, as well as the .NET Core 1.1 and 2.0 SDKs. You can install these manually from the internet, or through the Visual Studio Installer.

# Documentation
The documentation for the latest stable version is available at [dsharpplus.github.io](https://dsharpplus.github.io/).

Do note that the documentation might not reflect the latest changes in nightly version of the library.
